Tools for dealing with data from the national student clearinghouse

## Purpose
Handling data from the [National Student Clearinghouse](www.studentclearinghouse.org) (NSC).
"Tools" means tips, tricks, templates, and code.
The target audience are data managers and analysts that want to work directly with data from the NSC.

## Caveat
**DO NOT** put _actual data_ from the NSC on this repository!!!
Such data are usually protected by data-sharing agreements.
This is a PUBLIC repository, so you would almost certainly violate the agreements, and possibly the law, if you upload data.
If you do upload data by accident, and you are not sure about how to remove it from the repo, PLEASE get in touch with [Ben Taft](mailto:ben.taft@career2cradle.org).
He will help you expunge it ASAP.
